Toast two pieces of bread
Spread butter on both pieces on only one side
Spread peanut butter on both pieces on the same sides as the butter
Drizzle honey on the same sides as the peanut butter and butter, because honey is better than jelly every time.
Massage the honey into the peanut butter so the honey doesn't drip everwhere

Merge the two slices or keep them separate and enjoy.
